# Customer_Project_Python

Amazon clothes sells clothes online. Customers come into the store, have 
meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a 
mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app 
or website.
